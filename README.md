# avr-tools
Scripts to download and compile the AVR toolchain: binutils, gcc, avr-libc, gdb and simulavr

NOTE: This is only meant to work for my personal projects right now and as such makes some assumptions
that probably aren't particularly universal. Feel free to adapt it to whatever you need, though!
